## Description

Creating this repo to track the steps of adding firebase to an iOS project in Objective-C.

The goal is to add each new firebase feature in a single commit, so that the steps can be read easily in the commit history.

Thinking about making a separate branch for Swift after completing the Objective-C rounds.
